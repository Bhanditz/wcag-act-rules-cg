## Test procedure

### Applicability

Any HTML or SVG element that is [exposed to assistive technologies](#exposed-to-assistive-technologies) and has a [semantic role](#semantic-role). 

### Expectation

For each test target all [required states and properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#requiredState) for that role as specified by [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria) are present.

## Assumptions

- Even though browsers and/or assistive technologies seem to support leaving out at least some [required states and properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#requiredState) if an [implicit value for role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#implictValueForRole) is specified in [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#implictValueForRole), we do not consider it enough to pass this rule, that WAI-ARIA specifies an implicit value for the required states or properties for a role.

## Accessibility Support

If browsers and/or assistive technologies supports leaving out [required states and properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#requiredState) if an [implicit value for role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#implictValueForRole) is specified in [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#implictValueForRole), failing this rule may not cause actual accessibility issues for users of assistive technologies. 

## Background

- [ARIA5: Using WAI-ARIA state and property attributes to expose the state of a user interface component](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/ARIA5)
- [WAI-ARIA required states and properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#requiredState)
-  [RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt)

## Test Cases

### Passed

```html
<!-- Element has required states and properties -->
<select role="combobox" aria-controls=""></select>
```

### Failed

```html
<!-- Element does not list required states and properties -->
<select role="combobox"></select>
```

### Inapplicable

```html
<!-- Element does not have a semantic role-->
<div>Some Content</div>
```
